/**
 * interactive-earth-3d
 *
 * Browser-only Three.js module that renders a single interactive Earth
 * sphere into a host element. Loaded lazily (dynamic import) by
 * LanguageGlobeSelector.astro when the language overlay first opens —
 * never imported from .astro frontmatter, never reached during SSR.
 *
 * Scope: Earth visual + interaction only. Language selection,
 * persistence, URL handling, and event dispatch stay in the host
 * component. This module has no knowledge of language codes; it just
 * accepts an optional initial focus point as { lat, lng } in degrees.
 *
 * Lifecycle contract (unchanged from earlier steps):
 *   - createInteractiveEarth(container, options) builds the scene,
 *     mounts a single canvas inside `container`, starts the rAF loop,
 *     and returns a handle.
 *   - handle.setIdleRotation(false) pauses the rAF loop without
 *     tearing anything down — re-open is instant; no second canvas.
 *   - handle.destroy() stops the loop, removes listeners, disposes
 *     geometries / materials / textures / renderer, and removes the
 *     canvas from the DOM. Called on `astro:before-swap` and
 *     `beforeunload` so view transitions and full page exits don't
 *     leak GPU resources.
 *   - handle.focusLatLng(lat, lng) snaps the globe so a point faces
 *     the camera. Used today for initial focus only.
 *
 * Visual layers (back-to-front in render order):
 *   1. Earth sphere — color map (canvas-generated, refined continents)
 *      + specular map (ocean glints, land matte) on MeshPhongMaterial.
 *   2. Cloud sphere — child of Earth at radius 1.012, MeshLambertMaterial
 *      with alpha-blended cloud texture; drifts slightly faster than
 *      the Earth so the atmosphere reads as alive.
 *   3. Atmosphere halo — back-side sphere at radius 1.06 with a
 *      Fresnel-style ShaderMaterial in additive blend mode. Cyan rim,
 *      no bloom, no post-processing.

  //     distant planet instead of a wide-angle ball. This is the
  //     framing NASA / cinema use for hero Earth shots.

  // and matte zones into the Pacific — a subtle wrongness that drained
  // realism even when no single frame looked broken. Dropping the
  // mask entirely until Step C swaps in a real specular WebP gives
  // the whole sphere one consistent, gentle response to the sun.

  // The remaining specular tuning aims for "cinematic restraint":

  //     day-side instead of punching a single tight hotspot. The
  //     previous 90 was in the plastic/varnish range; planets earn
  //     their drama from the terminator, not from a glint.
  // Land regions in the Blue Marble texture are dark enough (forests,

  // ── Lights ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // Three lights, all cheap. Re-balanced in the stronger-lighting
  // pass after the previous moderate bump turned out too subtle to
  // dominate Blue Marble's dark mid-tones.
  //
  //   • DirectionalLight — the "sun". Two changes:
  //     (a) Pulled FORWARD toward the camera: (-2.0, 1.8, 3.0) →
  //         (-1.5, 1.5, 2.7). The previous position had a light
  //         direction of (-0.49, 0.44, 0.74), giving the dead-
  //         center pixel of the visible face only N·L = 0.74 of
  //         the sun's intensity. The new direction (-0.44, 0.44,
  //         0.79) yields N·L = 0.79 at the same pixel and lifts
  //         the entire camera-facing hemisphere into the
  //         high-cosine zone. Still 3/4 framing (upper-left and
  //         forward), not flat camera-axis lighting.
  //     (b) Intensity 1.20 → 1.45 — a real key-light bump, not a
  //         token nudge. Bright land (Sahara, polar ice) saturates
  //         to white slightly sooner; that's correct, those things
  //         ARE bright in reality. The visible mid-tones (forests,
  //         mid-latitude oceans) get pushed into the readable
  //         register where they should have been.
  //   • AmbientLight — warm earthshine fill. 0.40 → 0.50. The only
  //     light that touches the unlit hemisphere directly. The bump
  //     keeps the dark side as a soft visible "Earth at night" glow
  //     (~0.75 final shaded value) rather than a black void, while
  //     leaving it ~2.6× darker than the lit side so the terminator
  //     stays clear. Color (0xfff3dc) unchanged.
  //   • HemisphereLight — atmospheric scatter. 0.32 → 0.42. Sky tint
  //     (0x9ab8ff cool atmospheric blue) on top, ground bounce
  //     (0x7a5e3a warm earth) below. Hemi is direction-biased fill,
  //     not flat fill, so this bump adds dimensional richness — cool
  //     polar caps, warm equatorial deserts — without making the
  //     sphere read as a uniformly bright disc.
  //
  // No new lights, no shadow maps, no post-processing. Material
  // stays MeshPhongMaterial. This is purely a light-rebalance plus
  // the small exposure lift on the renderer.

      //      cached low-res bitmap then gets GPU-upscaled to the

      //      the WebGL backing store (or no-ops if size matches),

      //      forces the browser to invalidate and re-rasterize the
      //      composited layer at its true resolution.
      //
      //   2) ResizeObserver only fires on box-size changes. CSS
      //      transforms don't change box size, so layouts driven by
      //      transform-based animations can leave the renderer with
      //      stale dimensions if the box was actually different at
