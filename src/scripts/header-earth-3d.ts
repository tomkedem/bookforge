/**
 * header-earth-3d
 *
 * Tiny dedicated Three.js wrapper that paints the SMALL header globe
 * as a real miniature Earth. Built on top of `earth-rendering-core.ts`
 * (the shared visual source of truth), so the small globe is now a
 * true miniature of the cinematic overlay Earth — same texture,
 * same material, same sun direction, same atmospheric rim, same
 * lighting model. Identity continuity: when the user clicks the
 * small globe, the large globe that launches is recognizably the
 * SAME object scaled up, not a CSS sticker opening into a
 * photorealistic sphere.
 *
 * What's different from the overlay wrapper — miniature-presentation
 * pass + interaction surface only, NOT visual identity. None of these
 * changes touch material, lighting, exposure, sun position, or the
 * atmosphere shader; all of those are inherited from the core
 * identically to the overlay.
 *
 *   • Geometry density: matches the overlay exactly (earth 96,
 *     atmosphere 64). The header now renders the full-resolution
 *     sphere so the silhouette and the Fresnel rim are byte-identical
 *     to the overlay's. Earlier passes used reduced counts (32, then
 *     64) on the assumption that small canvas == fewer triangles
 *     needed; the cost difference at 50 px viewport is invisible on
 *     any modern GPU and the silhouette quality gain reads clearly.
 *   • Pixel-ratio cap: 3 (vs 2 for the overlay). The header canvas
 *     is ~50 CSS px; even at DPR 3 the backing buffer is just 150²
 *     pixels, well under the overlay's 880² at DPR 2. The extra
 *     subpixel density makes the rim glow, the specular highlight,
 *     and the silhouette curve crisper — small render targets
 *     amplify perception of partially-blended thin pixel bands, so
 *     adding density there is the cheapest "presence" gain
 *     available without touching the lighting model.
 *   • Camera distance: 3.55 (vs 3.85 for the overlay). Brings the
 *     Earth slightly forward inside the canvas so it fills ~89% of
 *     the viewport vertically and the atmosphere halo sits at ~94%
 *     — eliminating the empty margin between the rim glow and the
 *     circular `border-radius: 50%` clip that previously read as
 *     "wasted space" in the header. Camera is still in telephoto
 *     range (FOV 35° unchanged), so perspective compression and the
 *     cinematic framing character are preserved. 3.55 keeps the
 *     atmosphere a comfortable margin inside the canvas; values
 *     under ~3.4 risk clipping the rim at the border-radius edge.
 *   • Renderer hint: powerPreference 'low-power'. The header canvas
 *     renders on demand only; no point waking a discrete GPU.
 *   • Render cadence: on-demand only. No requestAnimationFrame loop,
 *     no idle rotation, no drag handlers, no focus animation. A
 *     render() runs on four events:
 *       1. First paint (after constructor wires up the scene)
 *       2. Texture-load completion (after async fetch)
 *       3. setFocus() — language change
 *       4. setParallax() — pointer-hover offset
 *       5. ResizeObserver — host container size change
 *     Total cost while the header sits idle: zero GPU work.
 *   • No drag interaction. The CSS `pointer-events: none` on the
 *     canvas ensures the host's existing click + hover handlers on
 *     `.lgs-trigger` fire on the button, not the canvas.
 *
 * Active-language orientation contract — the visible region must
 * match the active language's focus point on first reveal AND on
 * every language change, regardless of pointer activity:
 *
 *   1. Constructor applies initialFocus to earth.rotation and
 *      zeros camera.rotation.
 *   2. While the WebP is loading, meshes are hidden. The host's
 *      pointermove handler may call setParallax during this window,
 *      which writes to camera.rotation while invisible.
 *   3. On texture load (or failure), the reveal-on-load callback
 *      RE-ASSERTS initialFocus on earth.rotation and zeros
 *      camera.rotation again before flipping visible to true. The
 *      first rendered frame is guaranteed to be the language focus
 *      point exactly — no parallax accumulation can leak through.
 *   4. setFocus (language-change path) does the same: write earth
 *      rotation + zero camera rotation, then render.
 *
 * All three paths route through the local `applyFocus` helper so
 * the math + camera-reset behavior is impossible to drift.
 *
 * What's identical to the overlay — the shared core enforces this:
 *
 *   • Texture URL                 /assets/globe/earth-day-2k.webp
 *   • Fallback canvas texture     none — there is no fake-continents
 *                                 fallback anywhere in the pipeline.
 *                                 The Earth + atmosphere are hidden
 *                                 until the real NASA WebP decodes;
 *                                 on failure they are revealed with
 *                                 a neutral dark solid color.
 *   • Texture color space         sRGB, anisotropy capped at 16
 *   • Camera                      35° FOV, position (0, 0, 3.85)
 *   • Sun world position          (-1.2, 1.3, 3.2)
 *   • Material                    MeshPhongMaterial, specular
 *                                 #1c2a3a, shininess 22, no specularMap
 *   • Lighting                    Ambient #fff3dc 0.55,
 *                                 DirectionalLight white 1.55 at sun,
 *                                 HemisphereLight 0x9ab8ff/
 *                                 0x7a5e3a 0.48
 *   • Tone mapping                Linear, exposure 1.12
 *   • Atmosphere shader           same vertex + fragment program
 *                                 (back-side sphere at 1.06, Fresnel
 *                                 `pow(rim, 5.0)`, sun-side blend
 *                                 with mix(0.18, 0.78), additive,
 *                                 no depth write)
 *   • Rotation convention         rotation.y = (-90° - lng) DEG,
 *                                 rotation.x = +lat DEG (clamped at
 *                                 the poles). Same UV calibration as
 *                                 the overlay.
 *
 * The previous header-specific tuning (exposure 1.25, sun 2.10,
 * specular #4a6c98 / shininess 30, atmosphere pow 3.0 with intensity
 * mix(0.26, 1.00)) was an attempt to compensate for perceived
 * dimming at small render targets. The compensations DROVE the
 * miniature away from the overlay's visual identity — wider fuzzy
 * halo, brighter plastic specular, washed-out terminator. Dropped.
 * The shared core's values give the same visual at every size; the
 * brightness illusion that motivated those overrides came from
 * different sources (silhouette resolution, fallback solid color,
 * lack of fallback continents) that are now fixed in the core.
 *
 * The handle's public surface is unchanged from the previous
 * implementation: createHeaderEarth, setFocus, setParallax, destroy,
 * canvas. LanguageGlobeSelector.astro is not touched.
