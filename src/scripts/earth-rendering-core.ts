/**
 * earth-rendering-core
 *
 * Shared visual source of truth for every Earth that Yuval renders.
 * Consumed by `interactive-earth-3d.ts` (cinematic overlay) and
 * `header-earth-3d.ts` (header miniature). The core enforces a
 * single material, lighting rig, atmosphere shader, sun position,
 * exposure, and tone-mapping — so "is the small globe the same
 * Earth as the large one?" is answerable by looking at one file.
 *
 * Callers may differ on geometry density, pixel-ratio cap, camera
 * distance, atmosphere rim exponent / intensity, exposure, and
 * power preference. Callers OWN their own lifecycle: rAF loop vs
 * on-demand render, resize observer, drag listeners, focus
 * animation, hotspot projection, refit diagnostics. The core
 * provides primitives (`sizeFromContainer`, `loadDayTexture`,
 * `disposeAll`); it does not impose a render cadence.
 *
 * Texture pipeline:
 *   The ONLY surface texture this module knows about is the real
 *   NASA Blue Marble WebP at `/assets/globe/earth-day-2k.webp`.
 *   There is no CPU-generated fallback. While the WebP is in
 *   flight the material has `map: null` and renders with a
 *   neutral dark solid color (`fallbackSolidColor`, default
 *   0x0a0a0a). Callers that want the Earth to remain hidden
 *   until the texture decodes can set `earth.visible = false`
 *   and `atmosphere.visible = false` after construction and flip
 *   them back inside the `loadDayTexture` callbacks. The neutral
 *   solid color is the only thing visible if the WebP fails.
 *
